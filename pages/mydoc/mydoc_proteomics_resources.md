To understand how thousands of cellular proteins are affected during growth or as a result of drug treatment or environmental stresses, technically Â­advanced approaches such as mass spectrometry (MS) have become essential research tools. In the Proteomics Core, state-of-the-art mass spectrometers such as LTQ-Orbitrap Fusion, Q-TOF (nano-ESI) and Q-STAR (MALDI) permit unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy in identifying protein sequences and their abundance.
